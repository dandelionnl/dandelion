          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> COLOR PALETTE: Middle-aged singles are likely to be attracted to colors that convey warmth, comfort, and sophistication. For the message we want to send, we use colors that convey a sense of boldness, sincerity, and inspiration. When you look at our values - which are connection, confidence, and trust - we tried to find colors that complement that. Based on this we created a color palette that feels both calm and hopeful

The color #E63946 (the deep red) is associated with passion, energy, and love, which may appeal to singles seeking companionship, but also the passionate feeling you get when you think about experiences. The color #F7A6A4 (the soft pink) is calming and nurturing, suggesting a sense of care and compassion, but also a sense of safety to explore. The color #FAF3EE ( the light beige) conveys a sense of simplicity, elegance, and refinement, which may appeal to those seeking a more mature and sophisticated lifestyle. Next to that, we used it for most of the buttons/background elements to create a more grounded feeling for the website.

The color #457B9D (the light cool blue) stands for freedom, imagination, and inspiration, which directly connects to the core value of stepping out of your comfort zone. It also radiates a sense of security, which relates to the target audience.  #1D3557 (the deep navy) suggests stability, trustworthiness, and reliability, which may resonate with singles seeking a long-term commitment. Overall, these colors convey a sense of warmth, comfort, and stability, which are qualities that middle-aged singles may value in their search for love and companionship. </li> 
<li><img src= "images/colorpalette.jpg" width="300" alt="colorpalette"></li>
            <li>	FONT CHOICES: The font we chose is bold and mature, as well as elegant and timeless. This is directly in connection with our target audience, which is middle-aged people. We want to clearly communicate to them that we are trustworthy and serious about our brand’s intentions, while also promoting a ‘get out of your comfort zone’ mindset.  We want them to be able to relate to us and expect that this font will bring a sense of familiarity to them.</li>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)
              The way the navigation bar is organized was aimed to be simple and easy to navigate. We have 4 navigation links that are all equally important. Since the website’s general goal is to be a source for crowdfunding, we decided to place the ‘Support us’ navigation link in second place after the landing page.  The third navigation link is the ‘Go dandelion’ page, which has the concept of our product explained, so it is aimed at bettering the understanding of potential customers of what it is that we offer. After that, we have our justifications page. 
              In the landing (home) page, we used 2 carousels in order to make the website a bit more interactive and interesting to look at. We used two different carousels because we felt like since the two of them have two different functions they have to be differentiated in some way. The carousel used for the values of our brand is bigger and bolder, including explanations of our values, so it’s clear what we want to communicate to the customer. The second carousel is meant to introduce the team behind Dandelion and their positions. When the carousel hovers over it stops, and it can additionally also be dragged manually by the user, which makes it easy to navigate and actually looks at all the photos equally. 
              In our ‘Go Dandelion’ page we used a column layout to spread the text equally and make the page look more appealing to the reader. We wanted to include a bit more text in a way that doesn’t make the user think that it’s too much or too boring to read, so we divided it in two to in a way ‘trick’ the customer that it’s not a long read. 
              In our ‘Support us’ page we included a card on the bottom. That way the text on the card, including the button stands out more and brings the attention of the user immediately there. The aim was to get more donations and have more people click on the button, which leads to our GoFundme page.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;The structure of the navigation and content (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)
              We have decided to put most of the information about our brand on the landing (home) page so that the user can immediately see who we are, what we do and why we want to do it. It doesn’t require a lot of work to go through the information and that’s what we aimed for – easy and simple navigation of the content. Additionally, the information added has buttons underneath it to ‘find out more’. That way the reader can also interact with the website in a way and is left curious to learn more. We have the vision, values, a snippet of our product description and the crowdfunding call on our landing page – enough to keep customers intrigued and at the same time not an overwhelming amount so that it becomes boring. We decided to not create a separate ‘about us’ or ‘meet the team’ page because the personality of our team isn’t our selling point – it’s the brand. 
              Our ‘Support us’ page is very simple and attention-grabbing, especially the part where the ‘donate’ button is. We wanted to accentuate that and make it simple to read and understand. Overcomplicating or overcrowding the content on that page specifically would probably lead to less interest from the user. 
              The ‘Go Dandelion’ page has a similar content distribution – information on top and button on the bottom that leads to a login form. As explained before, the columns were used for the distribution of the text. The text aims to introduce the users to our concept/product more in-depth and make them engaged. The ‘Free trial’ button’s aim is to make the customer interact with the page.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?
              The personality of our brand circles around creating security for our potential users and making them feel confident and connected. We want them to trust themselves and also the process. The way these values are integrated into our website design is by the 1) colour scheme:
              -	For the landing (home) page we opted to use the blue colours of our colour palette as blue is correlated to trust, security, imagination, intuition and inspiration. Those are all characteristics corresponding to our values and how we want the user to feel. 
              -	For the ‘Go Dandelion’ page we decided to use the pink and red colours from our palette to hint at more passionate connection, love and intimacy. Since our concept is related to connecting people, we wanted to hint at that.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Patterns and content:
              -      The content we chose to put on our website is simple, but straight to the point. It is aimed to encourage potential users to be more confident in themselves. 
              -      Since our target group is middle-aged singles, we strived to use interface patterns that are obvious and sequential so it’s easier to navigate.
              How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?
              For the marketing strategy, we opted for very similar stylistic choices for our posts. We wanted to communicate the same values and vision, so we chose to go with the blue colours from our palette and pictures that represent connection, trust and confidence. The website and the marketing strategy both do a good job of being intertwined, but slightly different at the same time. 
              The design fits the communication strategy with the same points – we strive to communicate that we want to create a safe space for our users to feel like themselves, that they can trust our company and that they should also trust in the process. So we portray that again through the colours, logo and content.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?
              The website design makes our product stand out, because it doesn’t necessarily put it on the nose that we are trying to ‘sell’ a service, but it catches the user’s attention to the emotion we are trying to inflict in them, the sense of trust and confidence. We created a specific page that explains the concept of our product better to also better showcase it. </li>

          <ul>

            <li><p>OUR TESTING GOALS We’re trying to find out if the following aspects of our website are clear:</p></li>
            <li> Are our values clear and do they align with the stylistic choices of the website?&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Are participants able to find the GoFundMe page?</li>
            <li>Are participants able to find our Instagram page, and do they see a connection between the content of our Instagram and the stylistic choices of the website?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What is their overall opinion on the website, and what do they think we could do better? &nbsp;</li>
			
			  <li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about</li> </ul><br>
  <br>
	<strong> PARTICIPANTS:</strong> We decided on doing 3 usability tests, with 3 different participants
We asked our participants to place themselves in our target group’s shoes. We did this by asking them ‘Imagine you’re a 45-year-old single, how would you navigate this website?’ <br>
<br>
      SETTING:
The test’s setting is as follows; we decided to have the tests on campus because we felt this was a good environment to get the most insights. Having the tests be done in person was also a very important factor to us. Next to that, we used a laptop to show the participants our website.<br>
<br>
PROTOCOL:
A member of our group filmed the hands of the participant, to show how they navigated the website on the keyboard. But with that the screen was also in the frame, to show what actions the participant was taking. We also asked the participants to think aloud, because this would give us a good insight into their train of thought.<br>
RESULTS: The participants succeeded in completing all task. They could find the pages well and quickly. He just didn't immediately notice what our values were. He confused this with vision. Our tester clearly sees the connection between our website and social media in terms of color use, style and design positive ux/ui elements Nice use of the carousel Nice but calm pictures Pictures match text Nice that the flower comes back Nice that the logo moves Buttons work well Nice logo Nice that you can see who is behind the company with photos negative ux/ui elements Design quiet could stand out more Text very difficult to read Blocks around text do not attract reading Use of color sometimes a bit boring, could be more attractive Font in combination with blocks makes it difficult to read.<br>

  <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Dandelion is a brand dedicated to middle aged singles. The dandelion symbolizes letting go and going with the flow. Trusting the process. Blowing all the seeds of a dandelion symbolizes good fate, a fighter that refuses to follow rules or regulations. We want to offer an environment of opportunity for everyone who is open to meeting someone special with the same intentions. The goal is to find someone to have by their side to do fun activities with and just experience life with someone again. Many people find it difficult to find a safe dating environment and that's exactly what we are. We want to help our visitors find their values ​​and boost their self-confidence to look for a partner in a safe environment. Our vision is therefore: “In a world full of insecurities and expectations that hold you back, we believe that you should take a leap of faith and not only trust yourself but trust the process; only then will you be open and confident enough to let go and be your true self.”</p>
          <p>Here are some of our objectives, see appendix media communication plan for more objectives</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We want to reach 500 Page views on Instagram in total by the 10th of April.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>We want to reach 100 accounts on our Facebook by the 10th of April.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Make them feel free to open up with new people.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>We want to gain the confidence of our users&nbsp;</li>
            <li>We want 300 likes in total on the 10th of April.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>We want 15 comments on our posts in total by April 10th.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Create a safe dating environment</li>
          </ul>
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We didn’t reach all the objectives and we will explain why. From the interviews we conducted with our target group, we received some great insights. These insights not only helped us define our content and product objectives but also some of the marketing objectives that helped us define our campaign. We learned that in defining marketing objectives, you have to really place yourself in the mindset of the target audience. How we did this was by looking at our target audience’s media behavior. For example how they spend the most time on social media during 7-9 am and 8-10 pm. This is then what we based our campaign schedule on, to make sure that our content would have the most effective reach to our target audience. We also learned that looking at why and how we post content has an immediate effect on whom we reach. For example, the Dandelion Instagram account is now following companies that have a direct link to the target group. This is so the algorithm will push our account to the desired potential consumers of our brand. During the defining period of our communication and media plan, we expected to reach all of our goals. Because we presumed that the objectives we set at the start were rational and reachable, when we launched our social media accounts we expected the following to start growing immediately. This didn’t really happen. Our following started growing when we took a more proactive approach to following companies and accounts with a direct link to the target audience. Something we didn’t expect to happen, was being able to have a live feed on google analytics. Because none of our team members were familiar with the program, it was a very surprising and helpful tool to look at our website’s engagement. Other learning points We learned a lot while working on this campaign. We ran into a number of things and found out which things worked and which didn't. The first thing we ran into was coming up with a name and a logo and the use of color. This turned out to be not as simple as we thought and did not immediately give the right look we were looking for. We've been working on this for a long time, actually just too long, so we started our social media planning too late. After we had established everything properly and were satisfied, we could start posting. After the first post, our instagram account was deleted. This was one of the things we hadn't anticipated. Unfortunately it took a few days before we could get our account back and we couldn't post anything anymore. This caused us to fall even further behind on our social media planning. We are not sure why our account was deleted, most likely this was because several people were active on the account at the same time. We have learned from this to check in advance what actions will cause your account to be deleted in order to prevent this the next time. In addition, we have also learned that it is important to keep up with social media planning because otherwise you will be behind everything and that causes stress.

We have learned from this to check in advance what actions will cause your account to be deleted in order to prevent this the next time. In addition, we have also learned that it is important to keep up with social media planning because otherwise you will be behind everything and that causes stress. We also found out that it is very difficult to gain new followers, especially at the beginning. When you have few followers, you notice that many people do not trust it completely and it is still too unclear what you intend to follow with the channel. It is also very difficult to really reach a certain target group, especially at age, this is difficult to manage. The same with some response objectives, apparently it takes a lot of effort for many users to respond to something. This may be because they are embarrassed or don't know what will happen to these results. We think that as soon as you get more followers, this threshold will be lower and lower. We have also learned that reels are good to use for expanding your reach.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In terms of marketing, we mainly used Instagram and Facebook and this worked well. If we were to continue with this brand/company, we would like to set up a campaign to ensure that we achieve more brand awareness in a different way. We would do this through a physical campaign and people on the street or in a place where many people of our target group come to stand and address them. We would also be more clear about what we stand for, because this could be even stronger. With the aim of ensuring that everyone knows at a glance what we do and what we stand for. With this we want to lower our bounce rate. We would also make an even clearer schedule so that no misunderstandings can arise from this. This planning will state exactly which post will be posted on social media per day and date, on which channel and with a text so that this process is accelerated and everyone can do it. We will also start 3 times a week with a day in which we all tell where we stand and what we need help with so that we continue to communicate with each other. Because communication is key and it is important to be on the same page with all of us to prevent more misunderstandings. Therefore we created a plan that we can use every week to keep a nice overview and use the same days and times to upload our content. In this way people know when to expect a post from us. Also we will post more content to stay in the algorithm to better our results.</p>
  <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
  <p>Content Explanation: Instagram &amp; Facebook posts We decided to start with a post to introduce the team. These are the first 5 pictures. By introducing the visitors to the people behind the company, you build a connection. With this we want to achieve that they feel safe on our platform. As a result, we hope that they will open up more quickly and that is only possible when you feel comfortable. With the 6th picture, we want to stimulate the people on our pages to be nice to others but also to themselves to feel more confident in the end. We want them to see what happens when you are a little bit nicer to the people around you and also to people you don’t know. It can bring you to nice conversations and that’s the beginning of a connection. We used the dark pink/ red color for the last button to grab the attention to the thing they shouldn’t do. We posted a reel (7th picture) because we wanted to reach more people on our Instagram page. We used some videos that people can relate to or are craving to have some day. We made a short reel which is 29 seconds long. We posted our brand name in the middle by using the blue colors of our colorpalette. With the 8th picture, we want to remind our visitors to live in the moment. We used the quote: ‘everything's better when we’re together’. But the picture explains that you have to pay attention to the people around you when you’re doing something fun. Live in the moment and put that phone away. We also asked a question in our caption saying: “Can you live one day without your phone?”. By using a question in our caption we try to get some responses which will help us reach our response objectives. Every week we will post a notification of the week (the 9th picture). This will remind them to have a certain mindset for the week or for the day. In this post it says: trust the process. Trust is one of the values of our brand and we want to communicate that in our posts. We hope it gives them a little hope and confidence by having that quote in their mind. The stairs (which are the 10th picture) represent the journey they have to get through to get to the connection they want to find. You will get there step by step and YOU CAN do it. We used some light blue for the letters because it’s more attention grabbing. The 11th picture is about wanting our visitors to all find a connection they can’t explain. Connection is also one of the values of our brand that we want to communicate that in our posts. We hope it gives them a little hope and confidence by having that quote in their mind to gain confidence to find that connection. Every week we will post a notification of the week. (12th picture) This will remind them to have a certain mindset for the week or for the day. In the 13th picture it says: You are BEAUTIFUL. Confidence is one of the values of our brand and we want to communicate that in our posts. We hope it gives them a little hope and confidence by having that quote in their mind. And they will feel extra beautiful this week and day. The 14th picture is ‘Feel the fear &amp; do it anyway.’ You have to experience the fear before you can find the connection you’re looking for. This post will give you the courage to do it anyway. Nothing is going to change if you don't feel the fear. Trust the process and feel the fear. The quote flying high (15th picture) means achieving a position in life where you are respected. This phrase means to be very happy or successful. To achieve our dreams we should take a step forward and do things that will help us prosper and flourish in life. We really liked the meaning of this quote and this represents the position we want to let our visitors feel. Every week we will post a notification of the week. (17th picture) This will remind them to have a certain mindset for the week or for the day. In this post it says: Today is your day. Live it to the fullest! Trust is one of the values of our brand and we want to communicate that in our posts. We hope it gives them a little hope and confidence by having that quote in their mind. This post will give them the courage to start their journey. Because if not now, then when? You’re not reaching your goal if you don’t start. Instagram &amp; Facebook stories This is a story we posted to introduce our brand name. It kind of gives a sense of what kind of style we've chosen that we want to stick with. This is also a photo that we use as a photo for our archive stories on our page. Through our stories we try to get reactions by using an accessible interactive way to reach our users. This story is posted at the beginning of the week with the aim of making users think about what they are going to work on. With this we also want to achieve that our users start their week with a positive attitude and can therefore open up more and more. With the ultimate goal of being able to find and enter into a connection through this open appearance.

            <li>&nbsp;Explanation: Most of the problems that middle-aged singles suffer from are not having somebody next to them to experience life with, fear to trust, and searching again for somebody new due to their age. 
           	Based on the generation we live in and how dating is different from how it used to be, our target audience faces problems meeting someone. </li>

            <li>Explanation We chose Instagram and Facebook as our social media pages because it is the best choice based on our target audience.

          <ul>

            <li>&nbsp;Variable costs: 0,21 x .. km&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Explanation: Customer Acquisition Costs: CAC = (Marketing and Sales costs + Salary costs Marketing en Sales) / (Number of new customers ) = 10.000 + 8.000 / 1.000 = 18 euros/ person Let’s say we spend around 10.000 on advertisements in the future in one month. We’re in a group of four and our salary is 2.000 a month the number of new people we want to reach is 1000 Distributing Costs: we have no distributing costs because we arrange the activities for our clients. We don’t have to pay for their transport. Because we’re not selling a physical product, we have no transport costs and don’t need storage for our products. fixed costs: rent for our office: 3.000/ month salary cost for our employees: 2.000 x 4 = 8.000 / month A standard app costs around 3.600 euros a year for the app and to keep it in the app store. 3.600/ 12= 300 euros/ month total: 11.300 fixed costs a month Costs that remain the same despite the volume of goods or services produced. Examples include salaries, rents, and physical manufacturing facilities. Because we don’t sell any physical products, we have no physical manufacturing facilities. variable costs: travel expenses 0,21 euros/ km Because we’re not selling any products, no costs vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services being produced. The only variable cost we will have is our travel expenses to get to the location of the activities. </li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>While looking at our problem interviews and the lean canvas version that was created after these interviews, a couple of things came to our attention. Firstly, we noticed that we didn’t have a great unfair advantage. Our concept was very basic, which was a good place to start, but also resulted in the fact that we didn’t stand out from other similar brands on the market. Second, we hadn’t established any key metrics yet. This made it hard for us to understand how our target audience would be using our services. However, these missing parts also came from the fact that we hadn’t specified a single product yet. By doing more research on the target audience, coming up with ideas on how to tackle these lacking parts of the lean canvas, and creating multiple product concepts, we began working on our demos for the solution interviews. We decided on having three demos, which were all different products that fit within the core values of our brand. After these solution interviews, we were able to define our unfair advantage and our key metrics, which resulted in our final lean canvas.</p>
