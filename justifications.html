          <ul>
            <li> COLOR PALETTE: Middle-aged singles are likely to be attracted to colors that convey warmth, comfort, and sophistication. For the message we want to send, we use colors that convey a sense of boldness, sincerity, and inspiration. When you look at our values - which are connection, confidence, and trust - we tried to find colors that complement that. Based on this we created a color palette that feels both calm and hopeful

The color #E63946 (the deep red) is associated with passion, energy, and love, which may appeal to singles seeking companionship, but also the passionate feeling you get when you think about experiences. The color #F7A6A4 (the soft pink) is calming and nurturing, suggesting a sense of care and compassion, but also a sense of safety to explore. The color #FAF3EE ( the light beige) conveys a sense of simplicity, elegance, and refinement, which may appeal to those seeking a more mature and sophisticated lifestyle. Next to that, we used it for most of the buttons/background elements to create a more grounded feeling for the website.

The color #457B9D (the light cool blue) stands for freedom, imagination, and inspiration, which directly connects to the core value of stepping out of your comfort zone. It also radiates a sense of security, which relates to the target audience.  #1D3557 (the deep navy) suggests stability, trustworthiness, and reliability, which may resonate with singles seeking a long-term commitment. Overall, these colors convey a sense of warmth, comfort, and stability, which are qualities that middle-aged singles may value in their search for love and companionship. </li>

            <li>	FONT CHOICES: The font we chose is bold and mature, as well as elegant and timeless. This is directly in connection with our target audience, which is middle-aged people. We want to clearly communicate to them that we are trustworthy and serious about our brand’s intentions, while also promoting a ‘get out of your comfort zone’ mindset.  We want them to be able to relate to us and expect that this font will bring a sense of familiarity to them.</li>

            <p>OUR TESTING GOALS&nbsp; &nbsp;We’re trying to find out if the following aspects of our website are clear:</p>
            <li> Are our values clear and do they align with the stylistic choices of the website?&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Are participants able to find the GoFundMe page?</li>
            <li>Are participants able to find our Instagram page, and do they see a connection between the content of our Instagram and the stylistic choices of the website?&nbsp;</li>

<li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about:<br>
  <br>
	<strong> PARTICIPANTS:</strong> We decided on doing 3 usability tests, with 3 different participants
We asked our participants to place themselves in our target group’s shoes. We did this by asking them ‘Imagine you’re a 45-year-old single, how would you navigate this website?’ <br>
<br>
      SETTING:
The test’s setting is as follows; we decided to have the tests on campus because we felt this was a good environment to get the most insights. Having the tests be done in person was also a very important factor to us. Next to that, we used a laptop to show the participants our website.<br>
<br>
PROTOCOL:
A member of our group filmed the hands of the participant, to show how they navigated the website on the keyboard. But with that the screen was also in the frame, to show what actions the participant was taking. We also asked the participants to think aloud, because this would give us a good insight into their train of thought.<br>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Dandelion is a brand dedicated to middle aged singles. The dandelion symbolizes letting go and going with the flow. Trusting the process. Blowing all the seeds of a dandelion symbolizes good fate, a fighter that refuses to follow rules or regulations. We want to offer an environment of opportunity for everyone who is open to meeting someone special with the same intentions. The goal is to find someone to have by their side to do fun activities with and just experience life with someone again. Many people find it difficult to find a safe dating environment and that's exactly what we are. We want to help our visitors find their values ​​and boost their self-confidence to look for a partner in a safe environment. Our vision is therefore: “In a world full of insecurities and expectations that hold you back, we believe that you should take a leap of faith and not only trust yourself but trust the process; only then will you be open and confident enough to let go and be your true self.”</p>
          <p>Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication and Media Plan.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We didn’t reach all the objectives and we will explain why. From the interviews we conducted with our target group, we received some great insights. These insights not only helped us define our content and product objectives but also some of the marketing objectives that helped us define our campaign. We learned that in defining marketing objectives, you have to really place yourself in the mindset of the target audience. How we did this was by looking at our target audience’s media behavior. For example how they spend the most time on social media during 7-9 am and 8-10 pm. This is then what we based our campaign schedule on, to make sure that our content would have the most effective reach to our target audience. We also learned that looking at why and how we post content has an immediate effect on whom we reach. For example, the Dandelion Instagram account is now following companies that have a direct link to the target group. This is so the algorithm will push our account to the desired potential consumers of our brand. During the defining period of our communication and media plan, we expected to reach all of our goals. Because we presumed that the objectives we set at the start were rational and reachable, when we launched our social media accounts we expected the following to start growing immediately. This didn’t really happen. Our following started growing when we took a more proactive approach to following companies and accounts with a direct link to the target audience. Something we didn’t expect to happen, was being able to have a live feed on google analytics. Because none of our team members were familiar with the program, it was a very surprising and helpful tool to look at our website’s engagement. Other learning points We learned a lot while working on this campaign. We ran into a number of things and found out which things worked and which didn't. The first thing we ran into was coming up with a name and a logo and the use of color. This turned out to be not as simple as we thought and did not immediately give the right look we were looking for. We've been working on this for a long time, actually just too long, so we started our social media planning too late. After we had established everything properly and were satisfied, we could start posting. After the first post, our instagram account was deleted. This was one of the things we hadn't anticipated. Unfortunately it took a few days before we could get our account back and we couldn't post anything anymore. This caused us to fall even further behind on our social media planning. We are not sure why our account was deleted, most likely this was because several people were active on the account at the same time. We have learned from this to check in advance what actions will cause your account to be deleted in order to prevent this the next time. In addition, we have also learned that it is important to keep up with social media planning because otherwise you will be behind everything and that causes stress. We have learned from this to check in advance what actions will cause your account to be deleted in order to prevent this the next time.

We have learned from this to check in advance what actions will cause your account to be deleted in order to prevent this the next time. In addition, we have also learned that it is important to keep up with social media planning because otherwise you will be behind everything and that causes stress. We also found out that it is very difficult to gain new followers, especially at the beginning. When you have few followers, you notice that many people do not trust it completely and it is still too unclear what you intend to follow with the channel. It is also very difficult to really reach a certain target group, especially at age, this is difficult to manage. The same with some response objectives, apparently it takes a lot of effort for many users to respond to something. This may be because they are embarrassed or don't know what will happen to these results. We think that as soon as you get more followers, this threshold will be lower and lower. We have also learned that reels are good to use for expanding your reach.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In terms of marketing, we mainly used Instagram and Facebook and this worked well. If we were to continue with this brand/company, we would like to set up a campaign to ensure that we achieve more brand awareness in a different way. We would do this through a physical campaign and people on the street or in a place where many people of our target group come to stand and address them. We would also be more clear about what we stand for, because this could be even stronger. With the aim of ensuring that everyone knows at a glance what we do and what we stand for. With this we want to lower our bounce rate. We would also make an even clearer schedule so that no misunderstandings can arise from this. This planning will state exactly which post will be posted on social media per day and date, on which channel and with a text so that this process is accelerated and everyone can do it. We will also start 3 times a week with a day in which we all tell where we stand and what we need help with so that we continue to communicate with each other. Because communication is key and it is important to be on the same page with all of us to prevent more misunderstandings. Therefore we created a plan that we can use every week to keep a nice overview and use the same days and times to upload our content. In this way people know when to expect a post from us. Also we will post more content to stay in the algorithm to better our results.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
